# 🧬 Foundations of Genomic Data Handling in R – Post 12: ShortRead

## 🚀 Why ShortRead?

Throughout this series, we've explored powerful Bioconductor tools for working with genomic ranges, alignments, sequences, and data manipulation. But there's been one crucial piece missing from our puzzle: **How do we get from raw sequencing data to the polished genomic objects we've been working with?**

This is where **ShortRead** enters the picture. ShortRead is the essential starting point that connects FASTQ files from your sequencer to the structured Bioconductor universe. It specializes in importing, quality assessment, and preprocessing of high-throughput sequencing data—the crucial first step in every NGS analysis pipeline.

Think of ShortRead as the foundation that everything else builds upon. Without quality-controlled, properly formatted sequencing data, all the sophisticated downstream analyses we've explored would be built on shaky ground.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔧 Getting Started with Raw Sequencing Data

Let's begin by working with the most fundamental unit of sequencing data—FASTQ files:

```r
# Install if needed
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("ShortRead")

# Load libraries
library(ShortRead)
library(Biostrings)

# Read FASTQ files
fq <- readFastq("sample.fastq")

# Examine the basic structure
fq
```

**Output:**
```
class: ShortReadQ
length: 1000000 reads; width: 76 cycles
```

ShortRead stores sequencing data in specialized objects that maintain both sequence and quality information:

```r
# Extract sequences (returns DNAStringSet)
sequences <- sread(fq)
head(sequences, 3)

# Extract quality scores (returns BStringSet)
qualities <- quality(fq)
head(qualities, 3)

# Extract read identifiers
ids <- id(fq)
head(ids, 3)
```

**Output:**
```
# Sequences
DNAStringSet object of length 3:
    width seq
[1]    76 ACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGT
[2]    76 GTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTAC
[3]    76 CGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTA

# Quality scores (Phred+33 encoding)
BStringSet object of length 3:
    width seq
[1]    76 IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
[2]    76 HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[3]    76 JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
```

Notice how the sequences are returned as **DNAStringSet** objects—connecting directly to the Biostrings package we explored earlier!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔍 Key Capabilities for Quality Assessment

ShortRead provides comprehensive tools for assessing sequencing quality:

### 1. Quality Assessment Reports

```r
# Generate comprehensive quality assessment
qa_result <- qa(fq, lane = "Lane1")

# Generate an HTML report
report(qa_result, dest = "quality_report.html")

# Access specific quality metrics
qa_result[["readCounts"]]
qa_result[["baseCalls"]]
qa_result[["readQualityScore"]]
```

### 2. Quality Score Analysis

```r
# Convert quality scores to numeric values
quality_scores <- as(quality(fq), "matrix")

# Calculate mean quality per read
mean_quality_per_read <- rowMeans(quality_scores)

# Calculate mean quality per position
mean_quality_per_position <- colMeans(quality_scores)

# Plot quality distribution
hist(mean_quality_per_read, breaks = 50, 
     main = "Distribution of Mean Quality Scores per Read",
     xlab = "Mean Quality Score")
```

### 3. Sequence Length and Composition Analysis

```r
# Analyze read lengths
read_lengths <- width(sread(fq))
table(read_lengths)

# Analyze nucleotide composition
nucleotide_freq <- alphabetFrequency(sread(fq), baseOnly = TRUE)
head(nucleotide_freq)

# Calculate GC content per read
gc_content <- letterFrequency(sread(fq), "GC", as.prob = TRUE)
hist(gc_content, breaks = 50, main = "GC Content Distribution")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ⚡ Quality Control and Preprocessing

ShortRead provides powerful filtering and trimming capabilities:

### 1. Quality-Based Filtering

```r
# Filter reads by minimum quality score
min_quality <- 20
quality_filter <- srFilter(function(x) {
  apply(as(quality(x), "matrix"), 1, min) >= min_quality
})

filtered_reads <- fq[quality_filter(fq)]

# Filter by read length
length_filter <- srFilter(function(x) width(sread(x)) >= 50)
length_filtered <- filtered_reads[length_filter(filtered_reads)]

# Combined filtering
combined_filter <- compose(quality_filter, length_filter)
high_quality_reads <- fq[combined_filter(fq)]
```

### 2. Trimming Operations

```r
# Trim low-quality tails
trimmed_reads <- trimTails(fq, k = 2, a = "A", successive = TRUE)

# Trim by quality score
quality_trimmed <- trimTailw(fq, k = 5, a = "5", halfwidth = 5)

# Remove adapter sequences (if known)
adapter_seq <- "AGATCGGAAGAG"
adapter_trimmed <- trimLRPatterns(
  Lpattern = adapter_seq,
  subject = sread(trimmed_reads)
)
```

### 3. Paired-End Read Processing

```r
# Read paired-end files
fq1 <- readFastq("sample_R1.fastq")
fq2 <- readFastq("sample_R2.fastq")

# Ensure reads are properly paired
stopifnot(identical(id(fq1), id(fq2)))

# Filter paired reads together
paired_filter <- function(fq1, fq2) {
  qual_filter <- srFilter(function(x) {
    apply(as(quality(x), "matrix"), 1, min) >= 20
  })
  
  # Apply same filter to both reads
  keep <- qual_filter(fq1) & qual_filter(fq2)
  list(fq1 = fq1[keep], fq2 = fq2[keep])
}

filtered_pair <- paired_filter(fq1, fq2)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔗 Integration with the Bioconductor Ecosystem

ShortRead seamlessly connects with all the packages we've explored:

### 1. Connection to Biostrings

```r
# Extract sequences for downstream analysis
clean_sequences <- sread(high_quality_reads)

# Use Biostrings operations
reverse_comp <- reverseComplement(clean_sequences)
gc_content <- letterFrequency(clean_sequences, "GC", as.prob = TRUE)

# Find specific patterns
pattern_matches <- vmatchPattern("AGATCGGAAGAG", clean_sequences)
```

### 2. Preparation for Alignment (GenomicAlignments)

```r
# Write cleaned reads for alignment
writeFastq(high_quality_reads, "cleaned_reads.fastq", compress = TRUE)

# After alignment, reads become part of the GenomicAlignments workflow:
# library(GenomicAlignments)
# aligned_reads <- readGAlignments("cleaned_reads_aligned.bam")
```

### 3. Quality Metrics as DataFrame

```r
# Create quality metrics DataFrame for downstream analysis
read_metrics <- DataFrame(
  read_id = as.character(id(high_quality_reads)),
  length = width(sread(high_quality_reads)),
  mean_quality = rowMeans(as(quality(high_quality_reads), "matrix")),
  gc_content = as.vector(letterFrequency(sread(high_quality_reads), "GC", as.prob = TRUE))
)

head(read_metrics)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 💯 Real-World Quality Control Pipeline

Here's a complete quality control pipeline using ShortRead:

```r
# Complete QC pipeline function
process_fastq <- function(input_file, output_file, min_quality = 20, min_length = 50) {
  
  # Read FASTQ file
  cat("Reading FASTQ file...\n")
  fq <- readFastq(input_file)
  
  # Initial statistics
  cat("Initial reads:", length(fq), "\n")
  
  # Quality assessment
  cat("Performing quality assessment...\n")
  qa_result <- qa(fq)
  
  # Filter by quality and length
  cat("Applying quality filters...\n")
  quality_filter <- srFilter(function(x) {
    apply(as(quality(x), "matrix"), 1, min) >= min_quality
  })
  
  length_filter <- srFilter(function(x) width(sread(x)) >= min_length)
  
  # Apply filters
  filtered <- fq[quality_filter(fq) & length_filter(fq)]
  
  # Trim low-quality tails
  cat("Trimming low-quality tails...\n")
  trimmed <- trimTails(filtered, k = 2, a = "5", successive = TRUE)
  
  # Final statistics
  cat("Final reads:", length(trimmed), "\n")
  cat("Reads retained:", round(length(trimmed)/length(fq)*100, 1), "%\n")
  
  # Write cleaned reads
  writeFastq(trimmed, output_file, compress = TRUE)
  
  # Return QA results
  return(qa_result)
}

# Use the pipeline
qa_results <- process_fastq("raw_reads.fastq", "cleaned_reads.fastq")
```
