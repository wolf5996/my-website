# 🚀 From R Markdown to Quarto: Why Visual Mode in VS Code is a Game Changer

For years, **R Markdown (`.Rmd`)** was the gold standard for writing reproducible reports, seamlessly blending code, text, and output within a single document. One of its most powerful features in RStudio was **Visual Mode**, a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor that made formatting intuitive, enabling users to style documents effortlessly **without manually writing Markdown syntax**.

But now, with **Quarto (`.qmd`)**, things have evolved—for the better! 🚀

## 💡 What is Quarto? Why Switch from R Markdown?

Quarto is the next-generation system for creating **reproducible reports, technical documents, blogs, books, and presentations**. Think of it as **R Markdown 2.0**—but more flexible, powerful, and designed for a **modern data science workflow**.

### 🔹 Key Advantages of Quarto

✅ **Multi-language support** – Not just for R! Write in **Python, Julia, JavaScript**, or even combine multiple languages in a single document 🔥\
✅ **Enhanced YAML headers** – Improved metadata handling, structured document settings, and better defaults 📜\
✅ **Better output formatting** – More control over styling, citations, cross-references, and scientific publishing 🎨\
✅ **Visual Mode in VS Code!** – A true game-changer for those who prefer a modern, full-featured coding environment

## 🎯 Why Visual Mode in VS Code is a Big Deal

Previously, **Visual Mode**, which simplified `.Rmd` editing in RStudio, was **exclusive to RStudio users**. But with **Quarto**, VS Code now gains the same powerful **WYSIWYG experience**, allowing users to:

🔹 **Edit and format text without Markdown syntax** 📝\
🔹 **Embed and run code chunks interactively** 🖥️\
🔹 **See real-time previews of tables, equations, and document styling** 👀\
🔹 **Enjoy a modern editor experience with Git integration, extensions, and custom workflows** 🔄

This means **Quarto + VS Code** now delivers a workflow that is **more powerful** than R Markdown in RStudio. **You’re no longer restricted to a single editor!**

## 🚀 Why Quarto (`.qmd`) + VS Code \> R Markdown (`.Rmd`) + RStudio

| Feature | R Markdown (`.Rmd`) | Quarto (`.qmd`) |
|------------------|------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Multi-language support** | R-only | R, Python, Julia, JavaScript |
| **Visual Mode in VS Code** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Cleaner YAML headers** | Limited | More readable and structured |
| **Extensibility** | Basic | Advanced (slides, blogs, books, interactive content) |
| **Editor flexibility** | RStudio only | VS Code, Jupyter, and RStudio |

With **Quarto**, the **entire workflow becomes cross-platform, cross-language, and cross-editor**. Whether you're in RStudio, Jupyter, or VS Code, you get **the same document experience**.

## 🔥 Getting Started with Quarto in VS Code

To begin using Quarto with VS Code:

1️⃣ **Install Quarto** (if you haven't already):\
👉 [Download Quarto]

  [Download Quarto]: https://quarto.org/docs/download/

2️⃣ **Ensure you have VS Code installed** and install the **Quarto extension**:\
👉 Open VS Code and install **Quarto** from the extensions marketplace.

3️⃣ **Start a new Quarto document**:

-   Open VS Code, create a `.qmd` file, and begin writing!
-   Use Visual Mode (`Ctrl + Shift + P` → `Quarto: Open Visual Mode`) for a WYSIWYG editing experience.

4️⃣ **Render your document**:

``` bash
quarto render my_document.qmd
```

5️⃣ **Preview and refine** – Enjoy the live preview and enhanced workflow!

## 🔧 My Personal Preferences for Quarto YAML Headers

To enhance the formatting and usability of my Quarto documents, I recommend the following YAML settings:

``` yaml
theme: darkly
highlight: monokai
toc: true
toc-depth: 3
toc-float: true
title-block-banner: true
self-contained: true
```

### 🔹 Why These Settings?

-   **`theme: darkly`** → A modern dark mode for better readability.
-   **`highlight: monokai`** → Syntax highlighting that looks great for code.
-   **`toc: true`** & `toc-depth: 3` → Enables a floating table of contents with up to 3 levels for easy navigation.
-   **`title-block-banner: true`** → Enhances document headers with better structure.
-   `self-contained: true` → Ensures your output document is standalone and can be shared with all your analysis and results.

By using these settings, you ensure that your documents are well-structured, readable, and optimized for both presentation and usability.

## 📌 Final Thoughts

### **Bottom Line:**

Quarto takes everything great about R Markdown and expands it into a truly **cross-language, cross-editor, and extensible** system. If you're still using `.Rmd` in RStudio, it's time to explore `.qmd` in **VS Code** and experience the **future of reproducible research and technical writing**.
