# 🔬 Bulk RNA-Seq Series – Post 7: Understanding FASTQ vs. FASTA Files

## 🛠 The Foundation of Any RNA-Seq Workflow: Your Files

Before diving into complex steps like alignment, quantification, and differential expression analysis, it’s important to understand the **core data formats** used in RNA-Seq. Two of the most foundational file types are:

- 📂 **FASTQ files** – Your **raw sequencing reads**
- 📂 **FASTA files** – Your **reference genome or transcriptome**

Though they may seem similar at first glance, **FASTQ and FASTA serve very different roles** in the bioinformatics workflow.

## 📂 FASTQ Files: Your Raw Sequencing Reads

FASTQ files are the **primary output of next-generation sequencing (NGS)** platforms like Illumina, and they serve as the **starting point of any RNA-Seq pipeline**.

Each sequencing read in a FASTQ file is recorded over **four lines**:
1. **Read Identifier** – begins with `@`, gives the read name and instrument metadata
2. **Nucleotide Sequence** – the actual DNA/RNA read (A, T, G, C, or N)
3. **Separator** – a `+` sign, which may repeat the read ID
4. **Quality Scores** – ASCII-encoded Phred scores representing the base call confidence

### 🧪 Example FASTQ Entry:
```text
@SEQ_ID
GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAAGGGTGCCCGATAG
+
!''((((+))%%%++)(%%%%).1*-+*''))**55CCF
```

### 📌 Key Characteristics of FASTQ:
- ✅ Contains **both sequence and quality information**
- ✅ Essential for **quality control** (e.g., FastQC)
- ✅ Used for **trimming**, **filtering**, and **alignment**

FASTQ files are the **raw material** of the RNA-Seq pipeline.

## 📂 FASTA Files: Your Reference Genome or Transcriptome

FASTA is a simpler format that stores **biological sequences**, typically used to represent:
- Genomes (e.g., `GRCh38.fa`)
- Transcriptomes (e.g., `transcripts.fa`)
- Protein sequences (e.g., `proteins.fa`)

Each sequence in a FASTA file has **two parts**:
1. **Header line** – starts with `>`, followed by a unique identifier
2. **Sequence line(s)** – the actual DNA, RNA, or protein sequence

### 🧬 Example FASTA Entry:
```text
>chr1
ATGCGTACGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTA
```

### 📌 Key Characteristics of FASTA:
- ❌ Does **not** include quality scores
- ✅ Used as a **reference** for mapping reads
- ✅ Required to build **genome indices** for aligners like STAR, HISAT2, and Minimap2

FASTA files are your **blueprint** – the standard to which your reads are compared.

## 📊 FASTQ vs. FASTA – A Quick Summary

| Format | Purpose             | Contains Quality? | Used For                   |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| FASTQ | Raw sequencing reads | ✅ Yes             | Trimming, alignment, QC   |
| FASTA | Reference sequences  | ❌ No              | Indexing, alignment       |

- **FASTQ** = Your input data (raw reads)  
- **FASTA** = Your reference genome or transcriptome

---

## 💡 Bonus Tip: Compressed Versions
Both FASTQ and FASTA files are often stored in compressed formats:
- `.fastq.gz` or `.fq.gz`
- `.fasta.gz` or `.fa.gz`

Tools like `zcat`, `gzip`, `pigz`, and `bgzip` are used for fast decompression and processing in pipelines.

## 📌 Key Takeaways

✔️ FASTQ files contain **raw sequencing reads with quality scores**  
✔️ FASTA files are **reference sequences** used for alignment  
✔️ Understanding both formats is crucial for interpreting RNA-Seq workflows  
✔️ You’ll use FASTQ at the **start** and FASTA throughout for **alignment and annotation**
