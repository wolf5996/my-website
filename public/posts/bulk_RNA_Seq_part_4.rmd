# 🔬 Bulk RNA-Seq Series – Post 4: Read Trimming & Filtering with Trimmomatic

## 🛠 Why Trimming Matters in RNA-Seq

After running **FastQC** and **MultiQC**, it's clear that raw sequencing reads often contain:

✔️ Adapter contamination\
✔️ Low-quality ends\
✔️ Short or poor-quality reads

These issues can **significantly compromise read alignment**, inflate error rates, and introduce bias into differential expression analysis.

**Trimming and filtering** your reads is a critical preprocessing step to ensure that downstream analysis is based on **reliable, high-confidence data**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧪 A Brief History of Trimming Tools

### 🔹 **Cutadapt: The Trailblazer**

Cutadapt, written in Python, was one of the **first adapter trimming tools** widely adopted in the bioinformatics community. It's praised for:

-   Simplicity in syntax\
-   Excellent adapter matching capabilities\
-   Compatibility with custom adapter sequences

While still used in many workflows, Cutadapt is primarily focused on **adapter removal** and **requires additional tools** for quality trimming and filtering.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🔧 **Trimmomatic: The Versatile Standard**

Trimmomatic, developed by the **Usadel Lab**, has become the **standard tool** for comprehensive read trimming in RNA-Seq workflows.

✔️ Written in Java – runs on most platforms with Java installed\
✔️ Supports both **single-end** and **paired-end** reads\
✔️ Performs adapter clipping, quality trimming, and length filtering in one command\
✔️ Highly customizable and script-friendly

It’s especially valued in **automated pipelines** and high-throughput analysis environments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚀 Typical Trimmomatic Command (Paired-End Example)

``` bash
java -jar trimmomatic.jar PE \
  sample_R1.fastq.gz sample_R2.fastq.gz \
  sample_R1_paired.fq.gz sample_R1_unpaired.fq.gz \
  sample_R2_paired.fq.gz sample_R2_unpaired.fq.gz \
  ILLUMINACLIP:adapters.fa:2:30:10 \
  LEADING:3 \
  TRAILING:3 \
  SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20 \
  MINLEN:36
```

### 🔍 What Each Option Does:

-   `ILLUMINACLIP:adapters.fa:2:30:10` – Detects and removes adapter contamination\
-   `LEADING:3` – Removes bases from the start of a read if below quality 3\
-   `TRAILING:3` – Removes bases from the end of a read if below quality 3\
-   `SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20` – Performs sliding window trimming; trims when average quality within a 4-base window falls below 20\
-   `MINLEN:36` – Discards reads shorter than 36 bases after trimming

These settings represent a **balanced, commonly used configuration** for general RNA-Seq quality filtering.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📘 Other Common Options in Trimmomatic

| Option | Description |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `CROP:<length>` | Cuts the read to a maximum length from the start |
| `HEADCROP:<length>` | Removes a set number of bases from the start of each read |
| `AVGQUAL:<threshold>` | Discards reads with average quality below a given threshold |
| `TOPHRED33` or `TOPHRED64` | Ensures Phred quality scores are in the desired encoding |

These options are useful for **fine-tuning your pipeline** to specific sequencing platforms or QC requirements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📄 Best Practices for Trimming

✅ Always use the correct adapter file for your library prep kit (e.g. Illumina TruSeq, Nextera)\
✅ Re-run **FastQC** post-trimming to verify improvements\
✅ Maintain paired/unpaired file integrity – important for aligners like **STAR** and **HISAT2**\
✅ Adjust `MINLEN` to avoid discarding valuable short transcripts, especially in degraded RNA samples

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔄 When to Use Cutadapt Instead

While Trimmomatic is the go-to tool for many workflows, **Cutadapt** is preferable when: - You need precise control over adapter trimming - You're working with non-standard adapter sequences - You want a simpler syntax for small-scale projects

Cutadapt also integrates well with modern wrappers like **Trim Galore!** and **fastp**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📌 Key Takeaways

✔️ Trimming removes unwanted adapter sequences and improves data quality\
✔️ Trimmomatic is a robust, flexible tool that handles both SE and PE reads\
✔️ Proper configuration of trimming parameters improves mapping and downstream results\
✔️ Post-trimming quality checks are essential for validating preprocessing effectiveness
