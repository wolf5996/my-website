# 🔬 Tidyverse Series – Post 6: Handling Categorical Data with `forcats`

## 🛠 Why `forcats`?

Categorical variables (factors) are essential in data analysis, but handling them in base R can be frustrating. `{forcats}` simplifies working with factors by providing **intuitive, readable functions** for:

✔️ **Reordering categories for better visualization**\
✔️ **Lumping small groups together**\
✔️ **Handling missing values efficiently**\
✔️ **Creating consistent factor levels across datasets**

Working with factors is crucial when dealing with **biological classifications, categorical survey responses, or any grouped data**. Let’s explore the key functions in `{forcats}` and how they enhance data manipulation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📚 Key `forcats` Functions

`forcats` provides multiple functions for handling categorical data efficiently. Below are the most commonly used ones, along with practical applications.

| Function            | Purpose                                               |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `fct_reorder()`     | Reorder factor levels based on a numerical variable   |
| `fct_rev()`         | Reverse the order of factor levels                    |
| `fct_lump()`        | Group infrequent categories into "Other"              |
| `fct_recode()`      | Rename factor levels                                  |
| `fct_explicit_na()` | Make missing values explicit                          |
| `fct_collapse()`    | Combine multiple factor levels into a single category |

Let’s examine these functions in detail with real-world examples.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔄 **Reordering Factor Levels with `fct_reorder()`**

By default, R **orders factor levels alphabetically**, which isn’t always meaningful. `fct_reorder()` allows us to **sort factors based on a numerical variable**.

### 🔹 Example: Ordering Genes by Mean Expression

Imagine we have **gene expression data**, and we want to order genes by expression level in a plot.

#### **Dataset Before Reordering**

| Gene  | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| TP53  | 12.3       |
| BRCA1 | 8.9        |
| EGFR  | 15.2       |

#### **Reorder Genes by Expression Level**

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(forcats)

df <- df %>%
  mutate(Gene = fct_reorder(Gene, Expression))
```

✅ Now, `ggplot2` will automatically order genes by their expression levels instead of alphabetically.

#### **Before vs. After Reordering in a ggplot2 Visualization**

``` r
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(df, aes(x = Gene, y = Expression)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

Without reordering, bars would be plotted alphabetically. **With `fct_reorder()` applied, genes are sorted by expression level!**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔄 **Reversing Factor Levels with `fct_rev()`**

Reversing the order of a factor is useful when **plotting ordered categories**.

#### 🔹 Example: Reversing Treatment Groups

``` r
df <- df %>%
  mutate(Treatment = fct_rev(Treatment))
```

This ensures that **“Control” appears at the top rather than the bottom in plots**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔄 **Lumping Small Categories with `fct_lump()`**

Often, datasets contain **many categories with very few observations**. `fct_lump()` allows us to **group infrequent categories into an "Other" category**, simplifying analysis.

#### 🔹 Example: Merging Small Sample Groups

``` r
df <- df %>%
  mutate(SampleType = fct_lump(SampleType, n = 3))
```

✅ This retains the **three most common categories** and groups the rest under "Other".

#### **Before & After `fct_lump()` Application**

| SampleType | Count |
|------------|-------|
| Control    | 150   |
| Treated    | 120   |
| Disease    | 80    |
| Unknown1   | 10    |
| Unknown2   | 5     |

➡️ **After `fct_lump(n = 3)`:** \| SampleType \| Count \| \|-----------\|-------\| \| Control \| 150 \| \| Treated \| 120 \| \| Disease \| 80 \| \| Other \| 15 \|

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔄 **Renaming Factor Levels with `fct_recode()`**

Sometimes, category names are **too long or not informative**. `fct_recode()` allows us to rename them efficiently.

#### 🔹 Example: Simplifying Condition Labels

``` r
df <- df %>%
  mutate(Condition = fct_recode(Condition,
                                "Ctrl" = "Control",
                                "Trt" = "Treatment"))
```

✅ Now, `"Control"` becomes `"Ctrl"` and `"Treatment"` becomes `"Trt"`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔄 **Making Missing Values Explicit with `fct_explicit_na()`**

By default, R treats missing factor levels as `NA`. Sometimes, it’s useful to **explicitly label them**.

#### 🔹 Example: Labeling Missing Values as "Unknown"

``` r
df <- df %>%
  mutate(Condition = fct_explicit_na(Condition, na_level = "Unknown"))
```

✅ Now, `NA` values are replaced with `"Unknown"`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📈 **Complete Example: Using `forcats` in a Workflow**

### **Scenario:** We have clinical trial data with patient conditions and treatment responses. We need to:

✔️ Reorder conditions by severity\
✔️ Lump minor conditions together\
✔️ Rename conditions for clarity

#### **Full Workflow**

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(forcats)

clinical_data <- clinical_data %>%
  mutate(Condition = fct_reorder(Condition, SeverityScore),
         Condition = fct_lump(Condition, n = 4),
         Condition = fct_recode(Condition,
                                "Mild" = "Low",
                                "Severe" = "Critical"))
```

✅ **Now, the dataset is clean, structured, and ready for visualization!**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📈 **Key Takeaways**

✅ `{forcats}` makes working with categorical data **intuitive and flexible**\
✅ `fct_reorder()` improves visualizations by ordering factors logically\
✅ `fct_lump()` is useful for **handling rare categories**\
✅ `fct_recode()` renames factors efficiently\
✅ Handling missing values with `fct_explicit_na()` improves data clarity
