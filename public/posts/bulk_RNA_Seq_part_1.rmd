# 🔬 Bulk RNA-Seq Series – Post 1: Introduction to Bulk RNA-Seq Analysis

## 🛠 Why Bulk RNA-Seq?

Bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a **fundamental technique** used to measure gene expression levels across different conditions, offering insights into **disease mechanisms, cellular functions, and therapeutic responses**.

### 🔹 Key Benefits of Bulk RNA-Seq:

✔️ **Quantifies thousands of genes simultaneously**\
✔️ **Identifies differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between conditions**\
✔️ **Enables pathway & functional enrichment analysis**\
✔️ **Facilitates comparisons between experimental conditions or patient groups**

Unlike **single-cell RNA-Seq**, which captures **cell-to-cell variation**, bulk RNA-Seq provides an **aggregate gene expression profile** across a **population of cells**. This makes it particularly powerful for studying **tissue-wide expression patterns** and conducting **large-scale transcriptomic analyses**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📚 The Bulk RNA-Seq Workflow: From Reads to Biological Insights

A typical **bulk RNA-Seq pipeline** consists of two major phases:

### **➡️ Phase 1: From Raw Reads to Count Matrices**

1️⃣ **Quality Control (FastQC, MultiQC)** – Assessing sequencing read quality to ensure reliable data.\
2️⃣ **Trimming & Filtering (Trimmomatic, Cutadapt)** – Removing adapters, low-quality bases, and contaminant sequences.\
3️⃣ **Read Alignment (STAR, HISAT2, Salmon)** – Mapping reads to a reference genome or transcriptome.\
4️⃣ **Quantification (featureCounts, HTSeq, Salmon)** – Generating gene expression count matrices.

### **➡️ Phase 2: From Count Matrices to Insights**

5️⃣ **Normalization & Transformation** – Preparing data for statistical analysis using methods like `DESeq2` and `edgeR`.\
6️⃣ **Differential Expression Analysis (DESeq2, limma-voom)** – Identifying genes that are significantly up- or downregulated.\
7️⃣ **Visualization & Data Exploration (PCA, Heatmaps, Volcano Plots)** – Summarizing expression changes and clustering patterns.\
8️⃣ **Pathway & Functional Enrichment (GO, KEGG, GSEA)** – Linking differentially expressed genes to biological pathways.

Each of these steps will be **covered in depth throughout this series**, providing a **hands-on guide to processing, analyzing, and interpreting bulk RNA-Seq data**.

✅ **How to interpret biological meaning** by performing **functional enrichment analysis**.\
✅ **Common pitfalls, batch effects, and reproducibility strategies** for robust RNA-Seq analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚀 Why This Series Matters for Bioinformatics & Genomics Research

Bulk RNA-Seq remains a **gold-standard method for transcriptomics research**, widely applied in: ✔️ **Cancer genomics** – Identifying gene expression changes in tumors vs. normal tissue.\
✔️ **Drug discovery** – Understanding transcriptomic responses to treatments.\
✔️ **Developmental biology** – Studying gene expression dynamics over time.\
✔️ **Immunology & infectious diseases** – Profiling immune responses to pathogens.

By mastering **bulk RNA-Seq analysis**, you’ll gain essential **bioinformatics skills** that are highly valuable in **academic research, biotechnology, and precision medicine**.
