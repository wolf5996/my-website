# 🧬 Foundations of Genomic Data Handling in R – Post 13: SummarizedExperiment

## 🚀 The Masterpiece Container

After our journey through the foundational components of Bioconductor—from **GRanges** and **DataFrame** to **plyranges** and **rtracklayer**—we arrive at the masterpiece that brings it all together: **SummarizedExperiment**. This isn't just another data structure; it's the culmination of thoughtful design that unifies genomic coordinates, experimental measurements, and metadata into a single, powerful object.

SummarizedExperiment represents the standard container for RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and virtually every experimental genomics workflow in Bioconductor. It elegantly solves the fundamental challenge of keeping experimental data, genomic coordinates, and sample information synchronized—preventing the nightmare of mismatched annotations that plague many genomic analyses.

Think of SummarizedExperiment as the Swiss Army knife of experimental genomics: it contains everything you need in one unified, well-organized package.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔧 The Elegant Three-Part Architecture

SummarizedExperiment is built around three core components that should feel familiar from our series:

```r
# Install if needed
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("SummarizedExperiment")

# Load libraries
library(SummarizedExperiment)
library(GenomicRanges)

# Create a basic SummarizedExperiment
se <- SummarizedExperiment(
  assays = list(counts = count_matrix),
  rowRanges = gene_granges,
  colData = sample_metadata
)
```

Let's create a concrete example to illustrate each component:

### 1. Assays: The Experimental Measurements

```r
# Create a count matrix (genes x samples)
set.seed(123)
count_matrix <- matrix(
  rpois(60, lambda = 10), 
  nrow = 6, ncol = 10,
  dimnames = list(
    paste0("gene", 1:6),
    paste0("sample", 1:10)
  )
)

# Multiple assays are common (raw counts, normalized, etc.)
normalized_matrix <- log2(count_matrix + 1)
```

### 2. rowRanges: Genomic Coordinates (Our GRanges Foundation!)

```r
# Create genomic ranges for our features
gene_ranges <- GRanges(
  seqnames = rep(c("chr1", "chr2"), each = 3),
  ranges = IRanges(
    start = c(1000, 5000, 10000, 2000, 8000, 15000),
    width = c(2000, 1500, 3000, 1800, 2200, 2500)
  ),
  strand = rep(c("+", "-"), each = 3),
  gene_id = paste0("gene", 1:6),
  symbol = paste0("SYMBOL", 1:6),
  biotype = rep(c("protein_coding", "lncRNA"), 3)
)
```

### 3. colData: Sample Information (Our DataFrame Structures!)

```r
# Create sample metadata
sample_info <- DataFrame(
  sample_id = paste0("sample", 1:10),
  condition = rep(c("control", "treatment"), each = 5),
  batch = rep(1:2, 5),
  sex = sample(c("Male", "Female"), 10, replace = TRUE),
  age = sample(25:65, 10, replace = TRUE)
)
```

Now we can create our complete SummarizedExperiment:

```r
# Combine everything
se <- SummarizedExperiment(
  assays = list(
    counts = count_matrix,
    logcounts = normalized_matrix
  ),
  rowRanges = gene_ranges,
  colData = sample_info
)

# Examine the object
se
```

**Output:**
```
class: SummarizedExperiment 
dim: 6 10 
assays(2): counts logcounts
rownames(6): gene1 gene2 gene3 gene4 gene5 gene6
rowData names(3): gene_id symbol biotype
colnames(10): sample1 sample2 ... sample9 sample10
colData names(5): sample_id condition batch sex age
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔍 Accessing and Manipulating Data

SummarizedExperiment provides intuitive accessors that connect to everything we've learned:

### Accessing Components

```r
# Access assay data
assay(se, "counts")           # First assay
assay(se, "logcounts")        # Named assay
assays(se)                    # All assays

# Access genomic coordinates (our GRanges!)
rowRanges(se)

# Access sample information (our DataFrame!)
colData(se)

# Access feature metadata
rowData(se)  # Same as mcols(rowRanges(se))
```

### Elegant Subsetting

The real power comes from synchronized subsetting:

```r
# Subset by genomic location
chr1_genes <- se[seqnames(se) == "chr1", ]

# Subset by feature properties
protein_coding <- se[rowData(se)$biotype == "protein_coding", ]

# Subset by sample characteristics
treated_samples <- se[, colData(se)$condition == "treatment"]

# Complex combined subsetting
filtered <- se[
  rowData(se)$biotype == "protein_coding" & width(se) > 2000,
  colData(se)$condition == "treatment" & colData(se)$age > 40
]
```

Notice how the rows and columns are automatically synchronized—no risk of mismatched annotations!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ⚡ Integration with Our Foundational Series

Let's see how SummarizedExperiment integrates with all the packages we've explored:

### 1. plyranges Integration

```r
library(plyranges)

# Use plyranges syntax on SummarizedExperiment
se %>%
  filter(seqnames == "chr1") %>%
  mutate(mean_expression = rowMeans(assay(., "counts"))) %>%
  select(gene_id, symbol, mean_expression)
```

### 2. rtracklayer Integration

```r
library(rtracklayer)

# Export feature ranges
export(rowRanges(se), "features.bed")

# Import additional annotations and add to the object
new_annotations <- import("additional_features.gtf")
rowRanges(se) <- rowRanges(se)[findOverlaps(rowRanges(se), new_annotations, select="first")]
```

### 3. GenomicAlignments Connection

```r
# SummarizedExperiment often created from alignment summaries
library(GenomicAlignments)

# Count reads in features (typical RNA-seq workflow)
bam_files <- BamFileList(c("sample1.bam", "sample2.bam"))
gene_counts <- summarizeOverlaps(
  features = gene_ranges,
  reads = bam_files,
  mode = "Union"
)
# gene_counts is already a SummarizedExperiment!
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 💯 Real-World Applications

### 1. RNA-seq Analysis Workflow

```r
# Complete RNA-seq analysis setup
library(DESeq2)

# SummarizedExperiment flows directly into DESeq2
dds <- DESeqDataSet(se, design = ~ condition + batch)

# Filter low-count genes using genomic information
keep <- rowSums(assay(dds) >= 10) >= 3 & width(dds) > 500
dds_filtered <- dds[keep, ]

# Run differential expression
dds_analyzed <- DESeq(dds_filtered)

# Results include genomic coordinates automatically
results_df <- results(dds_analyzed) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  cbind(as.data.frame(rowRanges(dds_analyzed)))
```

### 2. Multi-Assay Integration

```r
# Adding multiple data types to the same experiment
se_multi <- se

# Add protein abundance data
assay(se_multi, "protein") <- matrix(
  runif(60, 0, 100), 
  nrow = 6, ncol = 10,
  dimnames = dimnames(count_matrix)
)

# Add ChIP-seq signal
assay(se_multi, "h3k4me3") <- matrix(
  runif(60, 0, 50), 
  nrow = 6, ncol = 10,
  dimnames = dimnames(count_matrix)
)

# Now we can analyze relationships between data types
cor(assay(se_multi, "counts")[1, ], assay(se_multi, "protein")[1, ])
```

### 3. Genomic Context Analysis

```r
# Use genomic coordinates for context analysis
library(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene)

# Get promoter regions
promoters <- promoters(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene)

# Find genes with promoter overlap
promoter_overlaps <- findOverlaps(rowRanges(se), promoters)

# Add promoter information
rowData(se)$has_promoter <- seq_len(nrow(se)) %in% queryHits(promoter_overlaps)

# Analyze expression by genomic context
boxplot(rowMeans(assay(se, "counts")) ~ rowData(se)$has_promoter,
        ylab = "Mean Expression", xlab = "Has Promoter Overlap")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 The Complete Integration Story

Let's trace the complete data flow that brings together our entire series:

### 1. Data Generation and Quality Control
```r
# Start with raw sequencing data (ShortRead)
library(ShortRead)
raw_reads <- readFastq("sample.fastq")
clean_reads <- raw_reads[quality_filter(raw_reads)]
```

### 2. Sequence Processing
```r
# Extract and manipulate sequences (Biostrings)
library(Biostrings)
sequences <- sread(clean_reads)
gc_content <- letterFrequency(sequences, "GC", as.prob = TRUE)
```

### 3. Alignment and Counting
```r
# Align reads and count (GenomicAlignments)
library(GenomicAlignments)
aligned_reads <- readGAlignments("aligned.bam")
gene_counts <- summarizeOverlaps(gene_ranges, aligned_reads)
```

### 4. Annotation Import
```r
# Import additional annotations (rtracklayer)
library(rtracklayer)
additional_features <- import("annotations.gtf")
```

### 5. Unified Container Creation
```r
# Combine into SummarizedExperiment
final_se <- SummarizedExperiment(
  assays = list(counts = assay(gene_counts)),
  rowRanges = rowRanges(gene_counts),
  colData = DataFrame(sample_metadata)
)
```

### 6. Elegant Analysis
```r
# Manipulate with plyranges
library(plyranges)
results <- final_se %>%
  filter(seqnames == "chr1") %>%
  mutate(mean_expr = rowMeans(assay(., "counts"))) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_expr))
```
