# üß¨ Foundations of Genomic Data Handling in R ‚Äì Post 7: GenomicAlignments

## üöÄ Why GenomicAlignments?

After mastering **GRanges** and **GRangesList** to represent genomic intervals, we often need to work with sequence alignment data‚Äîthe foundation of most next-generation sequencing analyses. The **GenomicAlignments** package serves as the critical bridge between raw alignment files (BAM/SAM) and meaningful genomic analyses in R, enabling you to extract biological insights from ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and other NGS data where reads map to a reference genome.

**GenomicAlignments** builds upon the solid foundation of the IRanges/GenomicRanges infrastructure, adding specialized classes and methods for working with aligned reads from high-throughput sequencing experiments. This integration allows for seamless transitions between alignment data and other genomic analyses within the Bioconductor ecosystem.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîß Getting Started with GenomicAlignments

First, install and load the required packages:

``` r
# Install if needed
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("GenomicAlignments")
BiocManager::install("Rsamtools")

# Load libraries
library(GenomicAlignments)
library(Rsamtools)
```

The GenomicAlignments package works hand-in-hand with the Rsamtools package, which provides the low-level functionality for reading BAM/SAM files.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîç Key Classes in GenomicAlignments

GenomicAlignments introduces several specialized classes that represent different types of alignment data:

### GAlignments - Single-end read alignments

``` r
# Reading single-end alignments from a BAM file
bamfile <- BamFile("path/to/your/aligned_reads.bam")
reads <- readGAlignments(bamfile)

# Basic structure of a GAlignments object
reads
```

**Output:**

```         
GAlignments object with 10000 alignments and 0 metadata columns:
           seqnames strand       cigar    qwidth  start    end  width  njunc
              <Rle>  <Rle> <character> <integer>  <integer>  <integer> <integer> <integer>
      [1]     chr1      -     75M        75    3901  3975     75      0
      [2]     chr1      +     75M        75    4401  4475     75      0
      [3]     chr1      +     75M        75    4501  4575     75      0
      ...      ...    ...      ...       ...     ...   ...    ...    ...
  [10000]    chr22      +     75M        75  51222511 51222585     75      0
  -------
  seqinfo: 93 sequences from an unspecified genome
```

The GAlignments class stores: - **seqnames**: Chromosome or contig name - **strand**: Read orientation (+ forward, - reverse) - **cigar**: CIGAR string encoding matching/mismatching positions - **qwidth**: Original read length - **start/end/width**: Genomic coordinates of the alignment - **njunc**: Number of "junctions" (gaps in the alignment)

### GAlignmentPairs - Paired-end read alignments

``` r
# Reading paired-end alignments
paired_reads <- readGAlignmentPairs(bamfile)

# Structure
paired_reads
```

**Output:**

```         
GAlignmentPairs object with 5000 pairs and 0 metadata columns:
        seqnames strand: first       last    width: first     last
           <Rle>   <Rle>:<Rle>      <Rle> <integer>:<integer> <integer>
    [1]    chr1       +:+           +          75         75
    [2]    chr1       +:+           +          75         75
    ...     ...      ...:...        ...        ...        ...
 [5000]   chr22       -:-           -          75         75
  -------
  seqinfo: 93 sequences from an unspecified genome
```

GAlignmentPairs represents paired-end reads, linking the first and second reads of each pair.

### GAlignmentsList - Groups of alignments

``` r
# Creating from a list of GAlignments
gal1 <- readGAlignments(bamfile, param=ScanBamParam(what="qname"))
gal2 <- readGAlignments(bamfile2, param=ScanBamParam(what="qname"))
galist <- GAlignmentsList(sample1=gal1, sample2=gal2)

# Or from split operation
by_gene <- split(gal1, mcols(gal1)$gene_id)
```

GAlignmentsList stores multiple GAlignments objects, useful for organizing alignments by gene, sample, or other groupings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ‚ö° Powerful Functions for Alignment Analysis

### Counting reads in genomic features

``` r
library(GenomicFeatures)
library(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene)

# Get gene annotations
txdb <- TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene
genes <- genes(txdb)

# Count reads overlapping genes
counts <- summarizeOverlaps(features = genes, 
                           reads = reads,
                           mode = "Union")

# View the counts table
head(assay(counts))
```

**Output:**

```         
                 sample1
ENSG00000000003      158
ENSG00000000005        0
ENSG00000000419      520
ENSG00000000457      106
ENSG00000000460       78
ENSG00000000938       14
```

### Finding overlaps between reads and features

``` r
# Find which reads overlap which genes
overlaps <- findOverlaps(reads, genes)

# Count overlaps per gene
overlap_counts <- countOverlaps(genes, reads)

# Which genes have reads?
genes_with_data <- genes[overlap_counts > 0]
```

### Computing genome-wide coverage

``` r
# Compute coverage
cov <- coverage(reads)

# Visualize coverage on chromosome 1
plot(cov$chr1[1:10000], type="l", 
     xlab="Genomic position", ylab="Coverage")

# Export as BigWig for visualization in genome browsers
library(rtracklayer)
export(cov, "coverage.bw", format="bigWig")
```

### Extracting junction information

``` r
# Extract junctions from spliced reads
junctions <- summarizeJunctions(reads)

# Plot distribution of junction widths (intron sizes)
hist(width(junctions), breaks=50, 
     main="Intron Size Distribution", 
     xlab="Intron size (bp)")
```

### Extracting CIGAR operations and aligned sequences

``` r
# Extract aligned sequences
alignedSeqs <- extractAlignedSeqs(reads, Hsapiens)

# Analyze mismatches from CIGAR strings
cigar_ops <- cigarOpTable(cigar(reads))
cigar_ops
```

**Output:**

```         
     M     I     D     N     S     H     P     =     X
123456   234   567  1234  5678    12     0     0     0
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üß´ Real-World Applications with Code Examples

### RNA-seq Expression Quantification

``` r
library(GenomicAlignments)
library(GenomicFeatures)
library(Rsamtools)

# Create a BamFileList for multiple samples
bam_files <- BamFileList(c(
  "sample1.bam", "sample2.bam", "sample3.bam"
))

# Get exons by gene
txdb <- makeTxDbFromGFF("gencode.v38.annotation.gtf")
exons_by_gene <- exonsBy(txdb, by="gene")

# Count reads in genes with standard RNA-seq parameters
se <- summarizeOverlaps(
  features = exons_by_gene,
  reads = bam_files,
  mode = "Union",
  singleEnd = FALSE,
  ignore.strand = FALSE,
  fragments = TRUE
)

# Normalized counts for visualization
library(DESeq2)
dds <- DESeqDataSet(se, design = ~ 1)
normalized_counts <- counts(dds, normalized=TRUE)
```

### ChIP-seq Peak Analysis

``` r
# Import peak regions
peaks <- import("peaks.bed", format="BED")

# Read ChIP-seq alignments
chip_reads <- readGAlignments("chip.bam")
input_reads <- readGAlignments("input.bam")

# Calculate signal in peaks
chip_cov <- coverage(chip_reads)
input_cov <- coverage(input_reads)

# Calculate enrichment
enrichment <- chip_cov / (input_cov + 1)

# Get mean signal in each peak
peak_signal <- vector("numeric", length(peaks))
for (i in seq_along(peaks)) {
  peak_range <- peaks[i]
  peak_signal[i] <- mean(enrichment[seqnames(peak_range)][start(peak_range):end(peak_range)])
}
```

### Splice Junction Analysis

``` r
# Read spliced alignments
rna_reads <- readGAlignments("rna_seq.bam")

# Extract junctions
junctions <- junctions(rna_reads)

# Get junction counts
junction_counts <- table(mcols(junctions)$name)

# Filter for novel junctions not in annotation
txdb_junctions <- unlist(transcriptsBy(txdb, by="intron"))
known_junctions <- unique(IRanges(start=start(txdb_junctions), end=end(txdb_junctions)))
novel_junctions <- junctions[!overlapsAny(junctions, known_junctions)]
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üíØ Performance Considerations and Best Practices

GenomicAlignments is designed to handle large datasets efficiently, but there are strategies to optimize performance:

### Use parameter settings to reduce memory usage

``` r
# Only load what you need
param <- ScanBamParam(
  what = c("qname", "flag", "mapq"),  # Only these fields
  which = GRanges("chr1", IRanges(1, 10000000)),  # Only this region
  tag = c("NH", "MD")  # Only these tags
)

reads <- readGAlignments("sample.bam", param = param)
```

### Process files in chunks for very large datasets

``` r
# Define chunks by chromosome
chroms <- c("chr1", "chr2", "chr3", "chr4")

# Process each chunk
results <- list()
for (chr in chroms) {
  param <- ScanBamParam(which = GRanges(chr, IRanges(1, 500000000)))
  chunk_reads <- readGAlignments("huge.bam", param = param)
  
  # Process this chunk
  results[[chr]] <- processChunk(chunk_reads)
}

# Combine results
final_result <- do.call(c, results)
```

### Use streaming for very large files

``` r
# Open BAM file
bf <- BamFile("massive.bam", yieldSize = 100000)
open(bf)

# Process in chunks
while (TRUE) {
  chunk <- readGAlignments(bf)
  if (length(chunk) == 0) break
  
  # Process chunk
  processChunk(chunk)
}

close(bf)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîó Integration with Bioconductor Ecosystem

GenomicAlignments is designed to integrate seamlessly with the broader Bioconductor ecosystem:

### Integration with SummarizedExperiment

``` r
# From readGAlignments to SummarizedExperiment
se <- summarizeOverlaps(features, reads)
class(se)  # "RangedSummarizedExperiment"

# Access count data
head(assay(se))

# Access feature information
head(rowData(se))

# Access sample information
colData(se)
```

### Integration with rtracklayer for visualization

``` r
library(rtracklayer)

# Export coverage for genome browser visualization
export(coverage(reads), "coverage.bigWig", format="bigWig")

# Export junctions in BED format
export(junctions(reads), "junctions.bed", format="BED")
```

### Integration with BSgenome for sequence extraction

``` r
library(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19)

# Extract sequences at alignment positions
seqs <- extractAlignedSeqs(reads, BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19)
letterFrequency(seqs, letters=c("A", "C", "G", "T"), as.prob=TRUE)
```
