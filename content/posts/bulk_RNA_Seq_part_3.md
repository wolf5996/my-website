# 🔬 Bulk RNA-Seq Series -- Post 3: Quality Control with FastQC & MultiQC

## 🛠 Why Quality Control Matters in RNA-Seq

Before analyzing RNA-Seq data, we need to ensure that our raw reads are **high quality**. Poor-quality reads can introduce **errors and biases**, affecting alignment and differential expression analysis.

✔️ Identifies **sequencing errors and adapter contamination**  
✔️ Detects **overrepresented sequences and GC content biases**  
✔️ Ensures **high-quality data for downstream analysis**

The two main tools used for **RNA-Seq quality control** are **FastQC** and **MultiQC**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📚 FastQC: Assessing Read Quality

**FastQC** is the go-to tool for checking raw sequencing reads. It generates a **comprehensive report** on:

✔️ **Per base sequence quality** -- Are the reads high-quality throughout?  
✔️ **GC content distribution** -- Does the dataset match expected GC levels?  
✔️ **Adapter contamination** -- Are sequencing adapters present?  
✔️ **Overrepresented sequences** -- Do specific sequences dominate the data?

### **➡️ Running FastQC:**

``` bash
fastqc sample1.fastq.gz sample2.fastq.gz -o qc_reports/
```

✅ Generates an **HTML report** with detailed metrics on read quality.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📊 MultiQC: Aggregating Reports for Multiple Samples

**MultiQC** simplifies batch processing by combining multiple FastQC reports into a **single interactive report**.

✔️ **Summarizes QC metrics across all samples**  
✔️ **Identifies systematic issues across datasets**  
✔️ **Provides an easy-to-interpret visual summary**

### **➡️ Running MultiQC:**

``` bash
multiqc qc_reports/ -o multiqc_report/
```

✅ Produces a **merged report** for all samples, making it easier to identify **consistent quality issues**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📈 Interpreting FastQC & MultiQC Results

After running FastQC and MultiQC, review the reports for:

✔️ **Poor quality bases** (especially at read ends) -- May need trimming.  
✔️ **Adapter sequences** -- Indicate contamination requiring removal.  
✔️ **Overrepresented sequences** -- Can reveal **rRNA contamination** or sequencing biases.  
✔️ **GC content deviations** -- Unexpected GC distribution may indicate contamination or sequencing artifacts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔄 Next Steps: Trimming & Filtering Low-Quality Reads

If FastQC highlights issues like **adapter contamination** or **low-quality bases**, the next step is **trimming** the reads to remove unwanted sequences. This ensures only **high-quality reads** proceed to alignment.

### **🔹 What's Next? Read Trimming with Trimmomatic & Cutadapt**

✔️ **Trimmomatic** -- Removes **low-quality bases and adapters**  
✔️ **Cutadapt** -- Efficient adapter trimming for Illumina reads  
✔️ **FASTP** -- Fast and fully automated quality control

We'll cover these tools in the next post!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📌 Key Takeaways

✔️ **FastQC assesses sequencing read quality** and identifies issues.  
✔️ **MultiQC aggregates reports**, simplifying quality control analysis for multiple samples.  
✔️ **Poor-quality reads impact downstream analysis**, making quality control essential.  
✔️ **Next step: Read trimming and filtering** to remove adapters and low-quality sequences.
