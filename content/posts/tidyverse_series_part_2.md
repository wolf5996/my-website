# 🔬 Tidyverse Series -- Post 2: Mastering Data Manipulation with `dplyr`

## 🛠 Why `dplyr`?

Data manipulation is at the core of every analysis, and `dplyr` makes it **fast, readable, and efficient**. Instead of struggling with base R syntax, `dplyr` provides **intuitive functions** that simplify data filtering, transformation, and summarization.

### ✔️ Why Use `dplyr`?

-   **Concise syntax** -- No need for complex nested functions.
-   **Pipe-friendly** -- Chain operations together seamlessly.
-   **Optimized performance** -- Handles large datasets efficiently.
-   **Consistent grammar** -- Each function has a clear purpose and complements the others.

Let's dive deep into the **five core verbs** of `dplyr` with **detailed explanations and real-world examples**!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📚 The 5 Key `dplyr` Verbs

### ➡️ `select()`: Pick Specific Columns

When working with large datasets, you often don't need all columns. `select()` helps you focus on the ones that matter.

#### Example: Selecting Relevant Variables

``` r
library(dplyr)

data %>%
  select(gene_id, expression_level, condition)
```

Here, we **select only the `gene_id`, `expression_level`, and `condition`** columns, excluding unnecessary ones.

#### Advanced: Selecting Columns by Pattern

Use **helper functions** to select columns dynamically:

``` r
data %>%
  select(starts_with("gene"))  # Select all columns that start with 'gene'
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ➡️ `filter()`: Subset Rows Based on Conditions

[`filter()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html) is used to **extract specific rows** that meet given conditions.

#### Example: Filtering for Highly Expressed Genes

``` r
data %>%
  filter(expression_level > 100)
```

This filters the dataset to **keep only genes with expression levels above 100**.

#### Multiple Conditions: Filtering by Multiple Variables

``` r
data %>%
  filter(expression_level > 100, condition == "treated")
```

This **filters for genes that are highly expressed AND belong to the treated condition**.

#### Using Logical Operators

``` r
data %>%
  filter(expression_level > 100 | condition == "control")
```

This **keeps rows where expression is high OR the gene belongs to the control group**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ➡️ `mutate()`: Create New Columns

`mutate()` is used to **add new variables** or modify existing ones.

#### Example: Calculating Fold Change

``` r
data %>%
  mutate(fold_change = expression_level / baseline_expression)
```

This **creates a new column `fold_change`** based on the ratio of expression level to baseline expression.

#### Conditional Mutations with `ifelse()`

``` r
data %>%
  mutate(high_expression = ifelse(expression_level > 100, "High", "Low"))
```

This **classifies genes into "High" or "Low" expression categories**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ➡️ `arrange()`: Sort Rows

Sorting data is crucial for ranking and prioritizing values. `arrange()` **sorts rows based on one or more variables**.

#### Example: Sorting Genes by Expression Level

``` r
data %>%
  arrange(desc(expression_level))
```

This **sorts genes from highest to lowest expression levels**.

#### Multi-Level Sorting

``` r
data %>%
  arrange(desc(expression_level), condition)
```

This **sorts first by expression level (descending), then by condition (alphabetically)**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ➡️ `summarize()` + `group_by()`: Aggregate Data

Summarizing data is essential for calculating statistics across groups.

#### Example: Calculating Mean Expression per Condition

``` r
data %>%
  group_by(condition) %>%
  summarize(mean_expression = mean(expression_level))
```

This **groups data by condition** and computes the **mean expression level for each group**.

#### Multiple Summaries

``` r
data %>%
  group_by(condition) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_exp = mean(expression_level),
    max_exp = max(expression_level),
    min_exp = min(expression_level)
  )
```

This **computes multiple summaries at once**, making analysis more efficient.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📊 Complete Example: Filtering & Summarizing Gene Expression Data

Imagine we have a dataset of **gene expression levels**. We want to: 1. **Filter for highly expressed genes**. 2. **Compute the mean expression per condition**.

### ➡️ Base R Approach

``` r
df_high <- df[df$expression_level > 10, ]
mean_exp <- tapply(df_high$expression_level, df_high$condition, mean)
```

This approach works, but it's **clunky and less readable**.

### ➡️ Tidyverse Approach

``` r
df %>%
  filter(expression_level > 10) %>%
  group_by(condition) %>%
  summarize(mean_expression = mean(expression_level))
```

✔️ **Cleaner**  
✔️ **More readable**  
✔️ **Easier to debug and extend**
