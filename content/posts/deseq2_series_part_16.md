# 🧬 Mastering Bulk RNA-seq Analysis in R -- Post 16: GSEA - When Gene Lists Aren't Enough!

## 📈 The Evolution Beyond Gene Lists

After mastering Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) with GO, KEGG, and Reactome, you've learned to ask: *"Are my significant genes enriched in specific pathways?"*

But what if the most important biological insights are hidden in genes that **didn't make your significance cutoff**? What if subtle but coordinated changes across entire pathways are more meaningful than a few dramatically changing genes?

Welcome to **Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)**---the method that uses your complete dataset to detect coordinated biological patterns that ORA completely misses.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 ORA vs GSEA: The Paradigm Shift

### 🔬 ORA: Testing Specific Genes One by One

-   Takes only genes with padj \< 0.05 (maybe 5% of your data)
-   Asks: "Are my significant genes enriched in this pathway?"
-   Ignores 95% of your expression data

### 📈 GSEA: Watching Entire Pathways Coordinate Together

-   Uses ALL genes ranked by fold change
-   Asks: "Is this entire pathway trending up or down across my complete dataset?"
-   Detects coordinated patterns regardless of individual significance

**The power**: Even genes with modest changes contribute if they're part of a coordinated pathway response.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚀 Setting Up GSEA Analysis

### Required Packages

``` r
# Core packages
library(clusterProfiler)    # Main GSEA functions
library(enrichplot)         # GSEA visualizations
library(org.Hs.eg.db)      # Human gene annotations
library(ReactomePA)         # Reactome pathways
```

**Key Resources**: - **clusterProfiler**: [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/clusterProfiler/) \| [GitHub](https://github.com/YuLab-SMU/clusterProfiler) - **ReactomePA**: [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/ReactomePA/)

### Preparing Your Ranked Gene List

``` r
# Starting with DESeq2 results
# Method 1: Rank by log2FoldChange (simple)
gene_list <- results$log2FoldChange
names(gene_list) <- rownames(results)

# Method 2: Rank by signed p-value (more robust)
gene_list <- sign(results$log2FoldChange) * (-log10(results$pvalue))
names(gene_list) <- rownames(results)

# Clean and sort
gene_list <- gene_list[!is.na(gene_list)]
gene_list <- sort(gene_list, decreasing = TRUE)

# Check your list
head(gene_list, 5)  # Top upregulated
tail(gene_list, 5)  # Top downregulated
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔬 Running GSEA with Three Databases

### GO Biological Process

``` r
# Convert to ENTREZ IDs
gene_list_entrez <- bitr(names(gene_list), 
                        fromType = "SYMBOL", 
                        toType = "ENTREZID", 
                        OrgDb = org.Hs.eg.db)

# Map to ranked list
gene_list_entrez_ranked <- gene_list[gene_list_entrez$SYMBOL]
names(gene_list_entrez_ranked) <- gene_list_entrez$ENTREZID

# Run GO GSEA
gsea_go <- gseGO(geneList = gene_list_entrez_ranked,
                 OrgDb = org.Hs.eg.db,
                 ont = "BP",
                 minGSSize = 15,
                 maxGSSize = 500,
                 pvalueCutoff = 0.05)
```

### KEGG Pathways

``` r
gsea_kegg <- gseKEGG(geneList = gene_list_entrez_ranked,
                     organism = "hsa",
                     minGSSize = 15,
                     maxGSSize = 500,
                     pvalueCutoff = 0.05)
```

### Reactome Pathways

``` r
gsea_reactome <- gsePathway(geneList = gene_list_entrez_ranked,
                           organism = "human",
                           minGSSize = 15,
                           maxGSSize = 500,
                           pvalueCutoff = 0.05)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📊 Understanding GSEA Results

### Key Metrics

``` r
# View top results
head(gsea_go@result, 5)

# Key columns:
# - NES: Normalized Enrichment Score (effect size and direction)
# - p.adjust: FDR corrected p-value  
# - core_enrichment: Leading edge genes driving enrichment
```

### 🎯 Interpreting NES (Normalized Enrichment Score)

-   **Positive NES**: Pathway enriched in upregulated genes
-   **Negative NES**: Pathway enriched in downregulated genes
-   **\|NES\| \> 2.0**: Very strong enrichment
-   **\|NES\| \> 1.5**: Strong enrichment

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎨 Essential GSEA Visualizations

### Single Pathway Enrichment Plot

``` r
# Classic GSEA plot for top pathway
gseaplot2(gsea_go, 
          geneSetID = 1,
          title = gsea_go$Description[1],
          color = "green")
```

### Multi-Database Comparison

``` r
# Compare results across databases
p1 <- dotplot(gsea_go, showCategory = 10, title = "GO GSEA")
p2 <- dotplot(gsea_kegg, showCategory = 10, title = "KEGG GSEA") 
p3 <- dotplot(gsea_reactome, showCategory = 10, title = "Reactome GSEA")

library(cowplot)
plot_grid(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 3)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔥 Real-World Example: My KO vs WT Analysis

### Key Findings Across Databases

**🟨 Upregulated in KO (Yellow bars in plots)**:

-   **KEGG**: Glucose metabolism, glycolysis pathways strongly upregulated

-   **Reactome**: Gluconeogenesis and energy production coordinated upregulation

-   **GO**: Ion transport processes enhanced

**🟦 Downregulated in KO (Blue bars in plots)**:

-   **KEGG**: Hippo signaling pathway suppressed

-   **Reactome**: Translation machinery heavily downregulated

-   **GO**: Wound healing and transcription processes coordinated downregulation

### Cross-Database Validation

``` r
# Quick summary
cat("GO significant pathways:", sum(gsea_go@result$p.adjust < 0.05), "\n")
cat("KEGG significant pathways:", sum(gsea_kegg@result$p.adjust < 0.05), "\n") 
cat("Reactome significant pathways:", sum(gsea_reactome@result$p.adjust < 0.05), "\n")
```

**Notice**: Different databases reveal complementary insights into the same underlying biology---metabolism coordinately upregulated, translation coordinately downregulated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ⚠️ GSEA Red Flags to Watch

🚩 **All pathways show weak enrichment** (\|NES\| \< 1.0)

🚩 **Contradictory results across databases**

🚩 **Only very large (\>500) or small (\<15) gene sets significant**

🚩 **No clear biological themes in top pathways**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 💡 GSEA vs ORA: When to Use What?

**Use ORA when**:

-   You have clear significant gene lists

-   Simple pathway membership questions

-   Preliminary exploration

**Use GSEA when**:

-   Subtle coordinated changes expected

-   Want to use complete expression data

-   Studying regulatory networks or metabolic coordination

-   ORA shows few/no significant pathways

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔥 Bottom Line

**ORA tells you**: "Which pathways contain your significant genes" **GSEA tells you**: "Which pathways are coordinately changing across your entire experiment"

My results show perfect examples: metabolism coordinately upregulated, translation coordinately downregulated---patterns that ORA's arbitrary cutoffs would completely miss! 🎯

The subtle but coordinated biological responses detected by GSEA often represent the most important regulatory changes in your system.
