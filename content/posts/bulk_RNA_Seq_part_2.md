# 🔬 Bulk RNA-Seq Series -- Post 2: Understanding RNA-Seq Reads & FASTQ Files

## 🛠 What Are RNA-Seq Reads?

RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) generates **millions of short reads** that represent fragments of transcribed RNA molecules. These reads provide **valuable insights** into gene expression, alternative splicing, transcript abundance, and novel transcript discovery.

✔️ Each read is a **short fragment** of cDNA generated during sequencing  
✔️ Reads can be **single-end (SE) or paired-end (PE)**  
✔️ Sequencing technologies generate raw reads in the **FASTQ format**, which we will explore in detail

Understanding RNA-Seq reads and their storage format is **crucial** for preprocessing and downstream analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📚 The FASTQ Format -- Storing Sequencing Reads

The **FASTQ file** is the standard format for storing **raw sequencing reads**. It contains both the **nucleotide sequences** and **quality scores** for each read.

Each read in a FASTQ file consists of **four lines**:

1️⃣ **Read Identifier** -- The unique read name, usually from the sequencer  
2️⃣ **Sequence** -- The actual nucleotide sequence (A, T, G, C)  
3️⃣ **Separator (`+`)** -- A separator line, sometimes repeating the identifier  
4️⃣ **Quality Scores** -- ASCII-encoded Phred scores indicating the confidence in each base call

### **Example FASTQ Entry:**

``` sh
@SEQ_ID
GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAAGGGTGCCCGATAG
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF
```

🔹 **Identifier (`@SEQ_ID`)** -- Read ID generated by the sequencer  
🔹 **Sequence (`GATTTGGGGTT...`)** -- The actual RNA-derived sequence  
🔹 **Separator (`+`)** -- Marks the beginning of the quality score line  
🔹 **Quality Scores (`!''*((...`)** -- ASCII-encoded Phred scores indicating confidence per base

These quality scores help determine **which reads are reliable** and should be retained for analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📊 Single-End vs. Paired-End Reads -- What's the Difference?

RNA-Seq reads can be generated in two different formats: **Single-End (SE) or Paired-End (PE)**.

### **🔹 Single-End (SE) Reads:**

✔️ Only **one read per fragment** is sequenced  
✔️ Faster and cheaper sequencing  
✔️ Suitable for **gene expression quantification**  
✔️ Less accurate for transcript assembly or alternative splicing studies

### **🔹 Paired-End (PE) Reads:**

✔️ **Two reads per fragment (forward & reverse strand)**  
✔️ Improved **alignment accuracy** due to extra information  
✔️ Essential for **alternative splicing detection** and transcript assembly  
✔️ **More expensive & computationally intensive**

💡 **Choosing Between SE & PE Reads:** If your goal is simple **gene expression analysis**, single-end reads might be sufficient. However, for **isoform discovery and structural variation detection**, paired-end sequencing is **highly recommended**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📈 Quality Control -- Ensuring High-Quality Reads

Before aligning reads to a reference genome, it's crucial to check sequencing quality. Poor-quality reads introduce **errors, misalignments, and biases** in downstream analyses.

### **🛠 Quality Control Tools**

✔️ **FastQC** -- Generates per-sample **quality control reports**

✔️ **MultiQC** -- Aggregates QC reports from multiple samples into a single summary

✔️ **Trimmomatic & Cutadapt** -- Removes **adapter sequences** and low-quality bases

### **🔹 What Does FastQC Check?**

✔️ **Per-base sequence quality** -- Detects low-quality regions in reads  
✔️ **Adapter contamination** -- Identifies non-biological adapter sequences  
✔️ **Overrepresented sequences** -- Flags possible technical artifacts  
✔️ **GC content distribution** -- Checks for biases in nucleotide composition

### **🔹 Running FastQC on a FASTQ File:**

``` bash
fastqc sample_1.fastq.gz -o qc_reports/
```

✅ This generates an HTML report with detailed QC metrics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔄 **Preprocessing FASTQ Files -- Cleaning Your Data**

After quality assessment, the next step is **trimming and filtering** the reads. This removes **low-quality bases, adapters, and contaminants**, ensuring only **high-quality reads** proceed to alignment.

### **🔹 Trimming Adapters with Cutadapt:**

``` bash
cutadapt -a AGATCGGAAGAGC -o sample_trimmed.fastq.gz sample_1.fastq.gz
```

✅ This command removes Illumina adapters and outputs a **cleaned FASTQ file**.

### **🔹 Trimming Low-Quality Bases with Trimmomatic:**

``` bash
trimmomatic SE -phred33 sample_1.fastq.gz sample_clean.fastq.gz LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:36
```

✅ This **removes low-quality bases** while ensuring that only reads longer than **36 bases** are retained.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📌 **Key Takeaways**

✔️ **RNA-Seq reads are stored in FASTQ files**, containing both sequences and quality scores.  
✔️ **Paired-end reads** provide better alignment accuracy and are essential for transcript assembly.  
✔️ **Quality control (FastQC, MultiQC)** ensures that poor-quality reads do not interfere with downstream analysis.  
✔️ **Preprocessing (Cutadapt, Trimmomatic)** removes adapter sequences and improves read quality before alignment.
