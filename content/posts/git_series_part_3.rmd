# 🛠️ Version Control Series – Post 3: Branching & Merging in Git 🌿

## 🌿 Branching: Experiment Without Fear

Imagine working on a new analysis without risking your main code. That’s what Git branches are for! Each branch is an independent workspace where you can develop features, test changes, and experiment freely.

### 🔹 Create a new branch

``` bash
git branch new_analysis
```

### 🔹 Switch to it

``` bash
git checkout new_analysis  # Older approach
git switch new_analysis    # Recommended approach
```

### 🔹 Work in isolation

Make edits, test scripts, and commit changes without affecting the main branch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔄 Merging: Integrate Your Work

Once satisfied, merge your branch back into `main` to make the changes official.

### 🔹 First, switch back to `main`

``` bash
git checkout main  # Older approach
git switch main    # Recommended approach
```

### 🔹 Merge the branch

``` bash
git merge new_analysis
```

Git integrates the changes, preserving a clean history.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ⚠️ What About Conflicts?

If Git encounters conflicting changes, it will prompt you to resolve them manually before merging.

### 🔹 Check for conflicts

``` bash
git status
```

### 🔹 Open the conflicting files, edit as needed, and save.

### 🔹 Mark as resolved

``` bash
git add <resolved_file>
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ✨ Key Takeaways

🌱 **Branches** let you experiment freely. 🔄 **Merging** integrates tested changes without disrupting ongoing work. ⚠️ **Resolve conflicts** carefully to maintain a clean project history.
