# 🔬 Bulk RNA-Seq Series – Post 10: Understanding GTF & GFF Files for Feature Annotation

## 1️⃣ Introduction: From Aligned Reads to Biological Insight

Once your reads are aligned (typically producing **BAM or SAM files**), the next major step in your RNA-Seq pipeline is **annotation**. Alignment tells you *where* your reads landed on the genome — but annotation tells you *what* they hit:

-   A gene?

-   An exon?

-   A retroelement?

Without reliable annotations, aligned reads are just genomic coordinates with no biological meaning. That’s where **GTF** and **GFF** files come in.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2️⃣ What Are GTF and GFF Files?

**GTF** (Gene Transfer Format) and **GFF** (General Feature Format) are plain-text files that define the locations and types of features on a genome. These include:

-   📍 **Exons**

-   📍 **Introns**

-   📍 **Coding sequences (CDS)**

-   📍 **UTRs**

-   📍 **Transcripts**

-   📍 **Genes**

Each line in a GTF or GFF file describes one feature and includes:

-   Chromosome name

-   Feature type (e.g., exon, CDS)

-   Start and end coordinates

-   Strand

-   Gene ID, transcript ID, and biotype (in the attributes column)

These annotations guide tools like **featureCounts** and **HTSeq-count** on how to assign reads to features.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3️⃣ GTF vs. GFF – A Quick Comparison

| Feature | GTF (GTF2.2) | GFF3 (General Feature Format v3) |
|----|----|----|
| Structure | Simpler, 9th field is unstructured | Rich metadata in key=value pairs |
| Popularity | Common in RNA-Seq workflows | Broader in genomics + non-coding RNAs |
| Compatibility | Supported by HTSeq, featureCounts | Required for some genome browsers |

### ✅ Bottom Line:

Both formats **define the biological meaning** behind your alignments. Choose based on **tool compatibility** and **annotation availability**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4️⃣ Why Annotation Matters

Annotations shape how we **interpret** read alignments:

-   🔍 **Where** do your reads land?

-   🔄 **What** gene or transcript do they belong to?

-   ⚠️ What **biotype** or **biological role** is associated?

> 📌 Changing your annotation file can **completely change your results** — even with the same BAM file.

Whether you use **GENCODE**, **Ensembl**, **RefSeq**, or a **custom annotation**, your choice impacts:

-   Gene-level counts

-   Transcript isoform analysis

-   Novel element detection

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5️⃣ Real-Life Example: ERVs (Endogenous Retroviruses)

**ERVs** are repetitive elements often *excluded* from default annotations.

To capture ERV activity:

-   🧬 Use an **ERV-specific GTF file** (e.g., from RepeatMasker or curated ERV databases)

-   🔁 Re-analyze previously aligned reads with the updated annotation

This is especially valuable in:

-   🦠 **Virology**

-   🧫 **Cancer biology**

-   🧬 **Immunology**

Even legacy datasets can reveal **new biological insights** with updated annotation files.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6️⃣ Best Practices: Choosing the Right Annotation

✔️ **Source matters**: GENCODE, Ensembl, and RefSeq annotations can vary widely in gene definitions and metadata\
✔️ **Version compatibility**: Make sure your annotation matches the genome build used in alignment (e.g., GRCh38 vs GRCh37)\
✔️ **Custom annotations**: Don’t hesitate to tailor your GTF if studying special features like ERVs, lncRNAs, or pseudogenes\
✔️ **Consistency is key**: Use the same annotation across alignment, counting, and downstream analysis to avoid mismatches

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7️⃣ What’s Next? Feature Counting

Once your reads are aligned and annotations are ready, the next step is to **count reads overlapping annotated features** using tools like:

-   📏 `featureCounts`

-   🐍 `HTSeq-count`

These tools depend heavily on your GTF or GFF file to decide how to group and quantify expression.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📌 Key Takeaways

✔️ GTF and GFF files add **biological meaning** to raw alignments\
✔️ Annotations impact **every step** of the RNA-Seq pipeline\
✔️ Custom annotations (e.g., ERVs) can unlock **new insights** from existing data\
✔️ Always validate your annotation format, version, and compatibility with analysis tools
