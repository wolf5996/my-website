# 🔬 Bulk RNA-Seq Series – Post 5: Read Alignment with STAR, HISAT2 & Minimap2

## 🧬 Why Alignment Matters in RNA-Seq

After quality control and trimming, your RNA-Seq reads are ready for one of the most critical stages in the workflow: **alignment**.

**Read alignment** involves mapping sequencing reads back to a reference genome or transcriptome to determine their origin. This is essential for:

✔️ **Quantifying gene and transcript expression**\
✔️ **Detecting splice junctions and novel isoforms**\
✔️ **Performing differential expression analysis**\
✔️ **Enabling transcript assembly**

Let’s explore three of the most widely used aligners: **STAR**, **HISAT2**, and **Minimap2**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ⚡ STAR: Ultrafast and Splice-Aware

**STAR (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference)** is one of the most popular RNA-Seq aligners, particularly for **short-read data** from Illumina platforms.

### 🔹 Key Features

-   Optimized for **speed** and high-throughput datasets\
-   **Splice-aware**: can detect both known and novel splice junctions\
-   Produces **sorted BAM files** and supports gene quantification

### 📦 Typical Use Case

Used in large-scale RNA-Seq studies such as TCGA, GTEx, and ENCODE.

### 📘 STAR Command Example:

``` bash
STAR --runThreadN 8 \
  --genomeDir genome_index/ \
  --readFilesIn sample_R1.fastq.gz sample_R2.fastq.gz \
  --readFilesCommand zcat \
  --outFileNamePrefix aligned/sample_ \
  --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate
```

✅ Output: Sorted BAM files ready for quantification or visualization

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 HISAT2: Lightweight and Graph-Based

**HISAT2** is a fast and memory-efficient RNA-Seq aligner designed as a successor to **TopHat2**. It uses a **graph-based index**, which makes it robust for transcriptome variation.

### 🔹 Key Features

-   **Low memory usage** compared to STAR\
-   Supports **spliced alignments** using genome annotation\
-   Compatible with downstream tools like **StringTie**

### 📘 HISAT2 Command Example:

``` bash
hisat2 -p 8 -x genome_index/genome \
  -1 sample_R1.fastq.gz -2 sample_R2.fastq.gz \
  -S sample.sam
```

✅ Output: SAM file for conversion to BAM using `samtools view`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🌐 Minimap2: Best for Long-Read Sequencing

**Minimap2** is a newer tool designed primarily for **long-read technologies** like Oxford Nanopore and PacBio, but it also supports spliced alignments for RNA-Seq.

### 🔹 Key Features

-   Handles **long and noisy reads** well\
-   Supports **spliced alignment** for RNA-Seq\
-   Essential for **third-generation sequencing platforms**

### 📘 Minimap2 Command Example:

``` bash
minimap2 -ax splice -t 8 genome.fa reads.fastq > aligned.sam
```

✅ Output: SAM file, easily converted to BAM and sorted for downstream analysis

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📊 Choosing the Right Aligner

| Tool     | Best For                      | Strengths                      |
|----------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| STAR     | Short-read Illumina data      | Fast, accurate, splice-aware   |
| HISAT2   | Compact genomes & limited RAM | Lightweight, annotation-ready  |
| Minimap2 | Long-read sequencing          | Long-read & noisy data support |

✅ All three generate alignment files compatible with **featureCounts**, **HTSeq**, and **StringTie**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📄 Post-Alignment Tips

-   **Validate BAM files** using `samtools flagstat` or `samtools stats`
-   **Sort and index** your BAM files with `samtools sort` and `samtools index`
-   Use **Qualimap** for detailed alignment statistics
-   **Visualize alignments** with IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📌 Key Takeaways

✔️ **STAR** is the go-to tool for high-throughput, short-read RNA-Seq alignment\
✔️ **HISAT2** is ideal when resources are limited or when graph-based indexing is preferred\
✔️ **Minimap2** is the best option for long-read RNA-Seq data\
✔️ Post-alignment validation is critical before proceeding to quantification
