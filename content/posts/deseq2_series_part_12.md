# üß¨ Mastering Bulk RNA-seq Analysis in R -- Post 12: QC Heatmaps for Sample Quality!

## üî• The Unsung Heroes of Quality Control

After using PCA to get the big picture view of your data in Post 11, it's time to zoom in on the fine details. While PCA shows you overall patterns, quality control heatmaps reveal the precise relationships between every pair of samples in your dataset.

These aren't the gene expression heatmaps we covered earlier - these are diagnostic tools that focus entirely on sample quality and relationships. Think of them as the detailed inspection that follows PCA's initial screening.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üéØ The Two QC Heatmap Champions

### üî• Sample Correlation Heatmap

**What it shows**: How similar each sample is to every other sample **Values**: Range from -1 to +1 (higher = more similar) **Purpose**: Reveals which samples have similar expression profiles

### üìä Sample Distance Heatmap

**What it shows**: Euclidean distances between samples in expression space **Colors**: Darker = more similar (counterintuitive but standard) **Purpose**: Shows clustering relationships and outliers

Both heatmaps should tell the same story, just with different visual approaches.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üí° Creating Your QC Heatmaps

### Basic Implementation

``` r
library(DESeq2)
library(pheatmap)

# Use transformed data (essential!)
vst_data <- vst(dds, blind = FALSE)

# Sample correlation heatmap
sample_cor <- cor(assay(vst_data))
pheatmap(sample_cor, 
         main = "Sample Correlation Heatmap",
         annotation_col = colData(dds)[c("condition")])

# Sample distance heatmap
sample_distances <- dist(t(assay(vst_data)))
sample_dist_matrix <- as.matrix(sample_distances)
pheatmap(sample_dist_matrix,
         main = "Sample Distance Heatmap", 
         annotation_col = colData(dds)[c("condition")])
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üåü What Success Looks Like

### Sample Correlation Patterns

**High correlations within conditions** (\>0.8-0.9)

-   Biological replicates should correlate strongly
-   Shows consistent sample preparation and biology

**Lower correlations between conditions** (\<0.7)

-   Different treatments should be less similar
-   Demonstrates your experimental manipulation worked

**Clear block pattern**

-   Visual blocks of high correlation matching your experimental design
-   Clean separation between treatment groups

### Sample Distance Patterns

**Dark squares within conditions**

-   Samples from the same group cluster together
-   Tight, consistent groupings

**Light squares between conditions**

-   Clear separation between different treatments
-   Hierarchical clustering follows biological logic

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üö© Red Flags and Troubleshooting

### Major Warning Signs

**Low correlations within replicates** (\<0.7)

-   Possible sample mix-ups or technical failures
-   Investigate individual samples immediately

**One sample correlates poorly with its group**

-   Check for sample degradation or processing errors
-   Consider removing if clearly problematic

**Samples cluster by batch, not condition**

-   Batch effects are stronger than biological effects
-   Need to model batch in your DESeq2 design

**No clear clustering pattern**

-   Weak experimental effects or high technical noise
-   May need more samples or stronger treatments

### Quick Diagnostic Steps

``` r
# Identify problematic samples
cor_matrix <- cor(assay(vst_data))
min_correlations <- apply(cor_matrix, 1, function(x) min(x[x < 1]))
potential_outliers <- names(which(min_correlations < 0.6))

print(paste("Potential outlier samples:", paste(potential_outliers, collapse = ", ")))

# Check batch effects
pheatmap(sample_cor, annotation_col = colData(dds)[c("condition", "batch")])
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üî¨ Real-World Interpretation Scenarios

### The Success Story

**What you see**: Beautiful blocks of high correlation (\>0.85) within each condition, clear separation between conditions, hierarchical clustering that perfectly matches your experimental design.

**What this means**: Your samples are high quality, your experimental conditions worked as intended, and your downstream analysis will be reliable.

### The Investigation Needed

**What you see**: One sample shows correlations of 0.6-0.7 with its supposed replicates but correlates well with a different condition.

**What this means**: Likely sample mix-up during processing. Check your sample tracking immediately and consider whether to reassign or remove the sample.

### The Batch Effect Discovery

**What you see**: Samples cluster perfectly by processing date rather than by treatment condition.

**What this means**: Technical variation is stronger than biological variation. You'll need to include batch in your DESeq2 model or use batch correction methods.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ‚ö° Pro Tips for Success

### Essential Technical Points

**Always use transformed data**: VST or rlog, never raw counts

-   Raw counts will be dominated by sequencing depth differences
-   Transformation makes correlations meaningful

**Remove low-expression genes**: Filter before calculating correlations

-   Low-expression genes add noise to correlation calculations
-   Focus on genes that are actually detectable

**Use meaningful sample names**: Make interpretation easier

-   Clear naming helps spot patterns and problems
-   Include key experimental factors in names

### Interpretation Guidelines

**Correlation values**:

-   0.9: Excellent replication

-   0.8-0.9: Good replication

-   0.7-0.8: Acceptable but investigate

-   \<0.7: Problematic, needs investigation

**Distance interpretation**:

-   Darker colors = more similar (yes, it's counterintuitive)
-   Look for clear blocks matching your experimental design
-   Outliers appear as lighter rows/columns

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üéâ Integration with Your QC Workflow

### The Complete Quality Control Pipeline

1.  **PCA plot**: Overall patterns and major issues
2.  **Sample correlation heatmap**: Detailed similarity relationships  
3.  **Sample distance heatmap**: Clustering validation
4.  **Decision point**: Proceed or investigate problems

### Decision Framework

**If QC heatmaps look good**:

-   High within-group correlations (\>0.8)
-   Clear between-group separation
-   Clustering matches experimental design
-   ‚Üí Proceed with differential expression analysis

**If QC heatmaps show problems**:

-   Low correlations within groups
-   Samples clustering by technical factors
-   Clear outliers or batch effects
-   ‚Üí Investigate and fix before continuing

### Quick Quality Assessment

``` r
# Automated quality check
assess_sample_quality <- function(vst_data, condition_column) {
  cor_matrix <- cor(assay(vst_data))
  conditions <- colData(vst_data)[[condition_column]]
  
  # Calculate within-group correlations
  within_group_cors <- c()
  for(cond in unique(conditions)) {
    group_samples <- which(conditions == cond)
    if(length(group_samples) > 1) {
      group_cors <- cor_matrix[group_samples, group_samples]
      within_group_cors <- c(within_group_cors, group_cors[upper.tri(group_cors)])
    }
  }
  
  avg_within_cor <- mean(within_group_cors)
  min_within_cor <- min(within_group_cors)
  
  cat("Average within-group correlation:", round(avg_within_cor, 3), "\n")
  cat("Minimum within-group correlation:", round(min_within_cor, 3), "\n")
  
  if(min_within_cor > 0.8) {
    cat("Sample quality: EXCELLENT\n")
  } else if(min_within_cor > 0.7) {
    cat("Sample quality: GOOD\n") 
  } else {
    cat("Sample quality: NEEDS INVESTIGATION\n")
  }
}

assess_sample_quality(vst_data, "condition")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîç The Bottom Line

**PCA shows the forest** - overall patterns and major variation sources **QC heatmaps show the trees** - precise sample relationships and quality

Together, they provide a comprehensive view of your data quality. These plots take 5 minutes to generate but can save you months of chasing artifacts or drawing conclusions from problematic data.

Don't skip this step. Quality control heatmaps are your safety net against sample mix-ups, batch effects, and technical failures that could invalidate your entire analysis.
