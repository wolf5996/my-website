# 🧬 Mastering Bulk RNA-seq Analysis in R – Post 4: Experimental Design & Count Matrix Setup

## 🎯 Why Design Formulas Make or Break Your Analysis

Here's a truth that catches many researchers off guard: **The most common place RNA-seq analyses go wrong isn't in the statistics—it's in how the biological question gets translated into statistical language.**

Your design formula is the blueprint that tells DESeq2 exactly what biological questions you want answered and how to account for the messy realities of experimental biology. Get this right, and DESeq2 will give you reliable, interpretable results. Get it wrong, and even perfect wet lab work won't save your analysis.

The good news? Once you understand the logic behind design formulas, choosing the right one becomes intuitive.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 Design Formula Fundamentals

The design formula serves three critical functions:

1.  **Identifies factors that affect gene expression** (treatment, genotype, batch, etc.)
2.  **Specifies what comparisons you want to make** (treated vs control)
3.  **Controls for confounding variables** (batch effects, patient differences)

The general pattern is: `design = ~ confounding_factors + biological_factors`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔬 Common Experimental Designs

### 1. Simple Two-Group Comparison

**Scenario**: Comparing treated vs control samples

``` r
# Design formula
design = ~ condition

# What this tests
treated_vs_control <- results(dds, contrast = c("condition", "treated", "control"))
```

**When to use**: Clean experiments with one factor of interest and good experimental controls.

### 2. Multiple Conditions

**Scenario**: Testing multiple treatments against a control

``` r
# Design formula
design = ~ treatment

# Possible comparisons
drugA_vs_control <- results(dds, contrast = c("treatment", "drugA", "control"))
drugB_vs_control <- results(dds, contrast = c("treatment", "drugB", "control"))
drugA_vs_drugB <- results(dds, contrast = c("treatment", "drugA", "drugB"))
```

**When to use**: Dose-response studies, multiple drug comparisons, time course experiments.

### 3. Paired/Matched Samples

**Scenario**: Before/after treatment in the same patients

``` r
# Design formula
design = ~ patient + condition

# What this does
# Controls for patient-to-patient differences, focuses on treatment effect
```

**When to use**: Clinical studies with matched samples, longitudinal designs, any situation where you can pair samples.

**Power boost**: This design dramatically increases statistical power by removing inter-individual variation.

### 4. Batch Effects

**Scenario**: Samples processed on different days or by different people

``` r
# Design formula
design = ~ batch + condition

# What this does
# Accounts for technical variation while testing biological effects
```

**When to use**: Almost always! Batch effects are incredibly common and often invisible until you look for them.

### 5. Factorial Design

**Scenario**: Testing interactions between factors

``` r
# Design formula
design = ~ genotype + treatment + genotype:treatment

# What this tests
# - Main effect of genotype
# - Main effect of treatment  
# - Interaction: does treatment work differently in different genotypes?
```

**When to use**: When you specifically want to test whether factors interact (e.g., does a drug work differently in males vs females?).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 💡 Design Formula Rules of Thumb

### Order Matters

Always put technical/confounding variables **first** and biological variables of interest **last**:

``` r
# Correct
design = ~ batch + sex + treatment

# Incorrect  
design = ~ treatment + batch + sex
```

This ensures DESeq2 properly accounts for confounders before testing your biological effects.

### Keep It Simple

Your design complexity should match your sample size:

``` r
# Simple design: OK with 3-4 replicates per group
design = ~ condition

# Complex design: Need 6+ replicates per combination
design = ~ genotype + treatment + genotype:treatment
```

**Rule of thumb**: Each factor level should have at least 3 biological replicates, preferably 5+.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📊 Sample Size Guidelines

| Design Type                       | Minimum per Group | Recommended         |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Simple (\~ condition)             | 3                 | 5-6                 |
| With batch (\~ batch + condition) | 3                 | 4-5                 |
| Factorial (\~ A + B + A:B)        | 3 per combination | 5-6 per combination |
| Time course (\~ time)             | 3 per timepoint   | 4-5 per timepoint   |

**Remember**: More replicates = more statistical power = more confident results.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ✅ Count Matrix Best Practices

### Pre-filtering Low-Count Genes

``` r
# Remove genes with very low expression
keep <- rowSums(counts(dds)) >= 10
dds_filtered <- dds[keep, ]

# Check the impact
cat("Genes before filtering:", nrow(dds), "\n")
cat("Genes after filtering:", nrow(dds_filtered), "\n")
```

**Why this helps**: Improves statistical power and reduces multiple testing burden.

### Factor Level Management

The reference level determines how comparisons are interpreted:

``` r
# Check current levels
levels(dds$condition)

# Set reference level (the "control" in your comparison)
dds$condition <- relevel(dds$condition, ref = "control")

# Verify the change
levels(dds$condition)  # "control" should be first
```

**Critical point**: This determines whether positive fold changes mean "up in treatment" or "up in control"!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ⚠️ Common Design Mistakes

### 1. Ignoring Batch Effects

**Problem**: Samples processed at different times often cluster by processing date rather than biological condition.

**Solution**: Always include batch information when available:

``` r
design = ~ batch + condition
```

### 2. Overly Complex Designs

**Problem**: Including too many factors or interactions with insufficient sample sizes.

**Solution**: Start simple and add complexity only when justified:

``` r
# Start here
design = ~ condition

# Add batch if needed
design = ~ batch + condition

# Add interactions only if specifically testing them
design = ~ batch + condition + batch:condition
```

### 3. Wrong Reference Levels

**Problem**: DESeq2 uses alphabetical order by default, which may not be your intended control.

**Solution**: Always set reference levels explicitly:

``` r
# This ensures "control" is your reference, not whatever comes first alphabetically
dds$condition <- relevel(dds$condition, ref = "control")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔬 Real-World Examples

### Time Course Study

``` r
# Design
design = ~ time

# Sample structure needed
# time1: 5 replicates
# time2: 5 replicates  
# time3: 5 replicates
# etc.
```

### Clinical Trial with Batch Effects

``` r
# Design
design = ~ batch + sex + treatment

# What this controls for
# - Technical variation (batch)
# - Biological confounders (sex)
# - Tests treatment effect
```

### Drug Combination Study

``` r
# Design
design = ~ drugA + drugB + drugA:drugB

# What this tests
# - Effect of drug A alone
# - Effect of drug B alone
# - Synergistic/antagonistic effects (interaction)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Putting It All Together

Here's a complete workflow for setting up your experimental design:

``` r
# 1. Load your data (from previous post)
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(counts, colData = metadata, design = ~ 1)

# 2. Examine your experimental factors
table(dds$condition)
table(dds$batch)  # if applicable

# 3. Set reference levels
dds$condition <- relevel(dds$condition, ref = "control")

# 4. Choose appropriate design formula
design(dds) <- ~ batch + condition  # adjust as needed

# 5. Pre-filter low-count genes
keep <- rowSums(counts(dds)) >= 10
dds <- dds[keep, ]

# 6. Verify everything looks correct
print(dds)
print(design(dds))
print(levels(dds$condition))
```
