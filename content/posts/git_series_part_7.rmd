# 🪠 Version Control Series – Post 7: Git Diff & Log – Tracking Changes Like a Pro

## 🔍 Why Tracking Changes Matters

Version control isn’t just about saving files—it’s about knowing **what changed, when, and why**. Git provides powerful tools to track modifications, helping you debug issues, review work, and collaborate effectively.

One of the biggest challenges in software development and data science is **tracking changes across different versions of your code**. With Git, you can pinpoint exactly what has changed between commits, branches, and even contributors. In this guide, we’ll explore how to track changes efficiently using `git diff` and `git log` and how modern tools like GitLens and Git Graph simplify the process.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔀 1️⃣ Viewing Changes with `git diff`

The `git diff` command allows you to see **line-by-line differences** between file versions. This is useful before committing changes or reviewing differences between branches.

### ✅ Basic `git diff` Usage

``` bash
git diff
```

This command shows **unstaged changes**, highlighting modified lines since the last commit.

### ✅ Viewing Staged Changes

``` bash
git diff --staged
```

Use this to see changes that are staged for the next commit.

### ✅ Comparing with the Latest Commit

``` bash
git diff HEAD
```

Compares the working directory with the latest commit, helping you track what has changed since your last save point.

### ✅ Comparing Two Commits

``` bash
git diff commit1 commit2
```

Replace `commit1` and `commit2` with actual commit hashes to see differences between any two points in history.

> 🔹 **Pro Tip:** Use `git diff --color-words` for a more readable diff that highlights word changes instead of whole lines.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📜 2️⃣ Checking Commit History with `git log`

The `git log` command helps you explore **the history of your project**.

### ✅ Viewing Basic Commit History

``` bash
git log
```

Lists commits in reverse chronological order.

### ✅ Simplified Log for Quick Overview

``` bash
git log --oneline --graph --all
```

This provides a **clean, visual representation** of the commit tree, making it easier to understand the history of your repository.

### ✅ Viewing the Last N Commits with Diffs

``` bash
git log -p -2
```

Displays the **last two commits** with detailed changes.

> 🔹 **Pro Tip:** Customize your log view with `git log --pretty=format:'%h - %an, %ar : %s'` for a cleaner history output.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📊 3️⃣ Making Git History Easier with GitLens & Git Graph

While Git’s command-line tools are powerful, **VS Code extensions like GitLens and Git Graph** make tracking changes much easier.

### 🔹 **GitLens** – Enhanced Git Capabilities

[GitLens] integrates Git deeply into VS Code, allowing you to: - View commit details **inline** - See who last modified a line of code - Navigate commit history effortlessly

  [GitLens]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens

### 🔹 **Git Graph** – A Visual Git History

[Git Graph] offers: - A **graphical representation** of branches and commits - The ability to **easily switch between branches** - Quick visualization of **merge histories**

  [Git Graph]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph

> 🔹 **Pro Tip:** Combine GitLens with Git Graph in VS Code for the ultimate Git experience!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

✅ **Use `git diff` to review changes before committing.**\
✅ **Use `git log` to navigate commit history effectively.**\
✅ **Extensions like GitLens & Git Graph simplify Git tracking in VS Code.**
