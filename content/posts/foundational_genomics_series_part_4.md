# üß¨ Foundations of Genomic Data Handling in R -- Post 4: IRanges

## üöÄ What is IRanges and Why Should You Care?

If you're working with genomic intervals in R --- whether it's genes, exons, or ChIP-Seq peaks --- the **IRanges** class is where it all begins. It's the foundation for more complex structures like `GRanges` and `SummarizedExperiment`, and it powers nearly every interval-based operation in Bioconductor.

IRanges represents **integer intervals** --- typically as genomic ranges --- in a memory-efficient, vectorized format. At its core, each range consists of:

-   A **start** position
-   An **end** position
-   A **width** (derived as `end - start + 1`)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ‚öôÔ∏è Creating IRanges Objects

You can construct an IRanges object using the `IRanges()` function from the `IRanges` package:

``` r
library(IRanges)

ir <- IRanges(start = c(1, 4, 10), end = c(3, 7, 12))
ir
```

**Output:**

    IRanges of length 3
        start end width
    [1]     1   3     3
    [2]     4   7     4
    [3]    10  12     3

These ranges could represent, for example, genomic features, coverage blocks, or transcription factor binding sites.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üõ† Accessor Functions

You can retrieve individual components of the ranges with:

``` r
start(ir)   # Start positions
end(ir)     # End positions
width(ir)   # Widths of the ranges
rev(ir)     # Reversed IRanges
```

These simple accessors enable flexible manipulation and exploration of ranges.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîç Core IRanges Operations

IRanges is incredibly powerful when performing set-like operations on ranges.

### üîÑ `reduce()`

Combines overlapping or adjacent ranges into one:

``` r
reduce(ir)
```

### ‚úÇÔ∏è `disjoin()`

Splits ranges into the smallest disjoint pieces:

``` r
disjoin(ir)
```

### üîé `findOverlaps()`

Finds all overlapping intervals between two IRanges:

``` r
query <- IRanges(start = c(2, 8), end = c(5, 11))
findOverlaps(query, ir)
```

### üî¢ `countOverlaps()`

Counts how many overlaps each query range has:

``` r
countOverlaps(query, ir)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üí° IRanges + Rle = Power

In **Post 2**, we covered the `Rle` class, which is frequently used in tandem with IRanges to represent things like:

-   **Coverage vectors**
-   **Masking regions**
-   **Strand-specific read counts**

This synergy allows efficient manipulation of large-scale data with **memory-saving tricks**.

``` r
coverage(ir)  # Returns an Rle vector
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìä Real-World Example: Overlapping Peaks and Genes

Imagine you have: - A BED file of ChIP-Seq peaks - A GTF file of gene annotations

You can convert both to IRanges and use:

``` r
findOverlaps(peaks_ir, genes_ir)
```

And just like that, you know which genes are near your peaks üîç

This logic scales --- even across **millions** of genomic intervals.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîÆ Why IRanges Matters

-   üìê Compact and elegant representation of intervals
-   ‚ö° Enables fast, vectorized overlap calculations
-   üß± Foundation of `GRanges`, `GRangesList`, and interval trees
-   üîó Essential for genomic operations like coverage, tiling, masking, annotation, and interval querying

Whether you're building pipelines, developing packages, or exploring your own genomic data, **IRanges is indispensable**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üß¨ What's Next?

Next up: **GRanges** --- where we bring chromosomes and strands into play. This will bridge your understanding of intervals with full genomic coordinates.

Stay tuned! üöÄ
