# 🚀 About Me – My Journey Through Bioinformatics  

Hi, I’m **Badran Elshenawy**, a **bioinformatician** passionate about unraveling the complexity of biological systems through **data, computation, and automation**.  

## 📖 My Journey Into Bioinformatics  
It all started with a fascination for how **biological systems adapt and evolve**. During my **DPhil at Oxford**, I dived deep into **hypoxic heterogeneity in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)** 🧫, exploring its molecular landscape using **bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing**.  

But my curiosity didn’t stop there. I became captivated by the **power of computation in biology**—how high-performance computing, automation, and command-line tools could transform data into discovery.  

Now, as a **postdoc**, my focus has shifted to **virology**, where I’m studying **chronic HBV infection** and its impact on the liver using **spatial transcriptomics and advanced imaging**. Working alongside some of the UK’s leading experts, I’ve come to appreciate not just the biological questions, but the computational challenges that come with them.  

## 🛠 My Core Expertise  
Over time, I’ve built a workflow centered on **efficiency, scalability, and reproducibility** in bioinformatics. My work revolves around:  

- 💻 **High-Performance Computing & Command-Line Automation** – Optimizing pipelines for large-scale bioinformatics analyses.  
- 🧬 **Transcriptomic Analysis** – scRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and bulk RNA-seq.  
- 🛠 **Git & Reproducibility** – Making computational biology more transparent and replicable.  
- 📊 **Data Science in R** – Seurat, ggplot2, and Bioconductor for transcriptomic insights.  

## 📝 Where I Write & Share  
I believe that knowledge should be shared, and I use my **personal website** and **LinkedIn** to discuss:  

- **Bioinformatics workflows & best practices**  
- **Command-line tools for efficiency**  
- **Automation & HPC for scaling analyses**  
- **Philosophies on productivity & deep work**  

If you're interested in **bioinformatics, computational biology, or the intersection of automation and science**, let’s connect.
